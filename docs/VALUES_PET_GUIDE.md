# Values Pet - Pou-Inspired ESP Educational Game

## Overview
Values Pet is an educational game inspired by Pou, where students interact with a virtual character to learn Filipino values through fun mini-games. The character has moods, stats, and reacts to the player's choices, making values education engaging and interactive.

## Core Concept (Pou-Inspired)
Just like Pou has feeding, cleaning, playing, and sleeping activities, **Values Pet** has ESP-themed mini-games:
- 🍽️ **Pagkain** - Healthy decision-making
- 🛁 **Linis** - Responsibility and hygiene
- 🌙 **Tulog** - Self-discipline and self-care
- 🎮 **Laro** - Social values and friendship

## Character System

### Character Stats (3 Progress Bars)
1. **Happiness (Kaligayahan)** 💗 - Red gradient bar
   - Increases when making good decisions
   - Represents emotional well-being
   
2. **Cleanliness (Kalinisan)** ✨ - Teal gradient bar

3. **Knowledge (Kaalaman)** 📚 - Yellow gradient bar

### Facial Expressions
The character changes expressions based on interactions:
- **Neutral** - Default calm state
- **Happy** 😊 - Curved eyes, big smile (after good choices)
- **Sad** 😢 - Dim eyes, frown (when stats are low)
- **Excited** 😲 - Wide eyes, open mouth (starting activities)
- **Thinking** 🤔 - One eye narrowed, straight mouth (making decisions)

### Idle Animation
