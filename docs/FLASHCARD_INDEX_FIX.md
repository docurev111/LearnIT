# Flashcard Index Fix

## Problem Identified

The flashcard completion was being recorded with **activity_index: 2** (which should be for the quiz), instead of the correct **activity_index: 3** (for flashcards).

### Activity Index Mapping
Based on the lesson content structure:
- **Index 0**: Video (Watch Video Lesson)
- **Index 1**: Reading (Read Lesson)
- **Index 2**: Quiz (Short exercise)
- **Index 3**: Flashcards (Practice Flashcards)

### What Was Wrong
In your database, the flashcards were recorded as:
```json
{
  "day_index": 0,
  "activity_index": 2,
  "activity_type": "flashcards"
}
```

This caused the quiz to show a checkmark even though you never completed it.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Frontend Fix 
**File**: `frontend/app/lessons/LessonFlashcardScreen.tsx`
- Changed `activityIndex` from 2 to 3
- Now flashcards will be recorded with the correct index

### 2. Backend Enhancement 
**File**: `backend/server_fixed.js`
- Added new DELETE endpoint: `DELETE /progress/activity`
- Allows removal of incorrect activity completions

### 3. Service Layer 
**File**: `frontend/services/activityService.js`
- Added `deleteActivityCompletion()` function
- Provides clean API to remove specific activity records

## How to Fix Your Database

You have **two options** to clean up the incorrect entry:

### Option 1: SQL Direct (Fastest) 
If you have access to your SQLite database, run this SQL command:

```sql
DELETE FROM progress
WHERE lesson_id = 1
  AND day_index = 0
  AND activity_index = 2
  AND activity_type = 'flashcards';
```

### Option 2: Use the Delete Endpoint (After restarting backend)
1. Restart your backend server to load the new DELETE endpoint
2. Make a DELETE request with your authentication:

```javascript
// Using axios or fetch
await axios.delete('http://10.210.1.244:3000/progress/activity', {
  data: {
    user_id: YOUR_USER_ID,
    lesson_id: 1,
    day_index: 0,
    activity_index: 2
  },
  headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer YOUR_ID_TOKEN' }
});
```

### Option 3: Just Move Forward 
Since the frontend is now fixed:
1. The incorrect entry (activity_index: 2) will remain in the database
2. But the frontend will only show checkmarks based on the correct indices
3. When you complete flashcards again, it will record with index 3
4. The quiz checkmark will disappear on its own because the frontend looks for activity_index: 2 with activity_type: 'quiz', not 'flashcards'

## Verification

After cleanup, reload your lesson intro screen. You should see:
-  Watch Video Lesson (completed)
-  Read Lesson (completed)
-  Short exercise (NOT completed - checkmark removed)
-  Practice Flashcards (ready to complete again with correct index)

## Next Steps

1. Complete the flashcards again in the app - it will now record with the correct index (3)
2. The progress tracking will be accurate going forward
3. All future activities will use the correct indices
